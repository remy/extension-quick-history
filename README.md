# Quick History

A Firefox plugin for searching your history using Fuse's [extended search sytnax](https://www.fusejs.io/api/query.html#use-with-extended-searching).

Currently not published in the Firefox add-ons as I'd like to give a bit of a run for a while to make sure it doesn't need more tuning.
